Identify critical time windows were sea surface temperature (SST), rainfall amount and chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a) explains most of the brood reduction variation.

## Chlorophyll-a/SST and food availability


**Sample**: Renesting attemps and manipulated nests were remove form the sample 
<br/><br/>
In order to evaluate if chlorophyll-a concentration and SST are an adequate proxies of food availability: Tested in chicks A and B separately the effect of chl-a and SST on offspring body mass at 70 days old.  
<br/><br/><br/>

### Results 

* Weekly minimum chlorophyll concentration (13 to 0.5 weeks prior to chick measurement for chick A and 10 to 1 weeks for chick B) with chlorophyll having the strongest effect during the first weeks of the chick's life and progressively diminishing as the chicks grow
<br/>
* Chick A mass was best correlated with the weekly maximum SST 11 to 1 week prior to measurement with the latest weeks having the strongest negative influence (see supp material fig S1b). Meanwhile chick B mass was best correlated with average SST 14 weeks prior to measurement.
<br/>
* Rainfall <span style="color:#c40062;">&rArr;</span> quadratic negative effect.
<br/>
* Laying date <span style="color:#c40062;">&rArr;</span> linear negative effect
<br/>
* Cohabitation time was only costly to chick B mass and parents 
<br/>
* Couple experience only had a positive effect on chick A mass

### II: Cost of sibling rivalry in offsprings
### III: Cost of sibling rivalry in parents fitness 
<br/>
**Objective:**\
Estimate the costs of sibling rivalry in offspring and parents by comparing families of 2 chicks where brood reduction occurred and analyzing how the time before brood reduction influence the offspring's and parents' fitness.  
<br/>

### Offsprings
<p class="fragment fade-right">
**Hyp**: Core chick defends their optimal condition and reduce the brood when their fitness is in danger\
**Pred**: Cohabitation time doesn't have any effect on core chick fitness in the short or long term\
</p>

<p class="fragment fade-right">
 <span style="color:#a6acad;">
**Hyp**: Because of the inclusive fitness, core chick would sacrifice x amount of their own condition 
 </span>
</p>

<p class="fragment fade-right">
**Hyp**: Core offspring doesn't have a complete control over their sibling survival\
**Pred**: Cohabitation time has a negative effect on core offspring survival
</p>
<br/>

### Parents

<p class="fragment fade-right">
**Hyp**: Parents have a delimited amount of resources to give at each reproductive event\
**Pred**: Longer cohabitation time doesn't reduce future reproduction of survival
</p>

## Offsprings analysis 

### Dependent variables 
<p style="text-align:left" class="fragment fade-right">
**Short term**:
<div style="text-align:left" class="fragment fade-right">
* body condition\
</div>

<p style="text-align:left" class="fragment fade-right">
**Long term:**
</p>
<div style="text-align:left" class="fragment fade-right">
* average laying date

## Results 

### Offsprings
<br/>
<div style="color:#c40062;" class="fragment fade-right">
**Hyp**: Core chick defends their optimal condition and reduce the brood when their fitness is in danger\
**Pred**: Cohabitation time doesn't have any effect on core chick fitness in the short or long term  
</div>
<br/><br/>

### Parents
<br/>
<div style="color:#c40062;" class="fragment fade-right">
**Hyp**: Parents have a delimited amount of resources to give at each reproductive event\
**Pred**: Longer cohabitation time doesn't reduce future reproduction of survival
